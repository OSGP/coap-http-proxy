# SNG COAP HTTP PROXY

This repository contains a CoAP-HTTP Proxy for use with the Stand-alone Notifying Gateway (SNG).
The proxy forwards CoAP messages from devices to a HTTP server, and returns the HTTP server's response back to the devices.

The CoAP server side is implemented using the [Eclipse Californiumâ„¢ framework](https://eclipse.dev/californium/).

The HTTP client side is implemented using a [Spring WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)

The payload received from the devices is expected to be a JSON string in [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) format and should contain an ID field.

The proxy performs a validation on the ID contained in the payload and the Identity used by the device when setting up a connection, before forwarding the message to the HTTP server.

The proxy supports DTLS. PSKs are retrieved from the [crest device service](https://github.com/OSGP/sng-crest-device-service/).
